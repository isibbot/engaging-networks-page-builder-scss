# Engaging Networks (EN) Page Buidler SCSS

This project is intended to make developing EN wrappers for their [http://support.engagingnetworks.net/page-builder](Page builder) app easier and allows the use of modern, snazzy tech to be used whilst hacking such as...

* [https://github.com/sass/node-sass](node-sass) for SCSS compilation.
* [https://browsersync.io/](Browsersync) has been included to speed up testing and developing across devices.

Future plans to add branchs for common frameworks like [http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html](Foundation 6 for sites), [https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/](Bootstrap 4) and the like.

## Usage

npm is used for build. No more extra dependancies for task runners required. Yay.

```
npm install
...
npm start
```
